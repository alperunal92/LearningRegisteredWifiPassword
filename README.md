# Learning Registered Wi-Fi Password Information via Powershell

# I wanted to tell you to learn the Wi-Fi password information registered on the computer via powershell. In fact, there are many tools that do this. But it is possible to do this without tools.

To do this, right-click the Start button or press Windows + R, and then type “powershell” in the search box and press enter.
